      <h2>To my love<br>(^-^)</h2>
      <p>
        You’re the best thing that life has given me so far and I know nothing can take your place in my heart.
        The love I have for you is pure and eternal! You bring so much joy into my life that it’s very hard for me
        even to imagine a life without you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It feels like I have been living in paradise since I met you. I love you not only for who you are, but for who I am with you.
        You have made me a better person and have always believed in me. I think I fell in love with you even before I met you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life comes with challenges but with you by my side, we can take on the world together. I love you for all what you are,
        all that you have been and all that you are yet to be.
        If I know what love is, it is because of you! 
        <strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY LOVE! HAPPY GIRLFRIEND’S DAY!</strong>
